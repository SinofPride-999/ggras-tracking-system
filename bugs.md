what i want you to do next, is generate all the milestones from the mdC:\Users\deinv\Desktop\code\GGRASS\DEV_PLAN_AI1.mdC:\Users\deinv\Desktop\code\GGRASS\DEV_PLAN_AI2.mdC:\Users\deinv\Desktop\code\GGRASS\DEV_PLAN_BE1.mdC:\Users\deinv\Desktop\code\GGRASS\DEV_PLAN_FE1.mdC:\Users\deinv\Desktop\code\GGRASS\DEV_PLAN_FE2.mdC:\Users\deinv\Desktop\code\GGRASS\DEV_PLAN_LEAD.md

and thenn  use that to seed the daabse, then proceed to add functionality for the admin to use add, the developers, using email, name salary.
When the dev tries logging in for the first time the password is set at that instant, u understand right??
now concerning the tasks, after seeding the databse the you wait for the admin to click the start ptoject functionality and then the timer starts for the countdown for the milestones and tasks, u understand what i am saying right??
tell me what u undestand from what i just said
